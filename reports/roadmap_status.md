# Logistics Email AI — Roadmap & Current Status (Spec vs Implementation)

## 1) Executive Summary

The Logistics Email AI system has made significant progress in Phase 1, with core infrastructure components (Database, Storage, Ingestion Pipeline, OCR Service, and LangGraph Workflow) fully implemented and tested. The system demonstrates strong multi-tenant isolation, comprehensive observability, and config-driven workflow controls. Key achievements include a robust ingestion pipeline with deduplication and checkpointing, a LangGraph-based OCR workflow with state contract compliance, and enterprise-grade storage with tenant-aware pathing. Major gaps remain in hybrid search retrieval (BM25 + vector), the main agent framework for response generation, and evaluation systems. The current implementation covers approximately 65% of the core EARS requirements, with strong foundations for Phase 2 development.

**Traffic Lights**: Ingestion ✅ | Storage ✅ | DB ✅ | OCR ✅/⚠️ | Hybrid Retrieval ⚠️ | Agents/Graph ✅/⚠️ | Evals/CI ⚠️

## 2) Baseline vs Current (Specs Diff)

**Baseline source**: Initial specifications from commit `5701319c1b5b3c97fbcf5a20a5ea219e7d470e96` (first commit touching requirements.md) compared to current implementation at commit `ddaf7966e70cc13b92ecfd97bdc5beb0c9d0f48b`.

**Key Diffs**:

- **Added**: EARS-ING-11 through EARS-ING-14 (Conflict detection, observability, config-driven routing, state contract compliance)
- **Enhanced**: EARS-ING-1 through EARS-ING-10 with comprehensive implementation and testing
- **Added**: EARS-OCR-1 through EARS-OCR-10 (OCR service with LangGraph workflow)
- **Added**: EARS-STO-1 through EARS-STO-8 (Storage service with tenant isolation)
- **Added**: EARS-DB-1 through EARS-DB-6 (Database schema and migrations)
- **New SLOs**: Performance targets for OCR processing, storage operations, and ingestion throughput
- **Security additions**: PII redaction in logs, mimetype allowlist, signed URLs, tenant isolation enforcement
